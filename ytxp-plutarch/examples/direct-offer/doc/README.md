# Direct offer

> Please note that this example project has not been audited and tested.

This example illustrates how to define the YTxP specification for a direct offer protocol. It is based on the direct offer example from Anatasia Lab. See [Direct Offer](https://github.com/Anastasia-Labs/direct-offer).

The high-level offer flow looks like this:

- Someone creates an offer.
- Either the offer owner will reclaim the offer,
- or a buyer will execute the offer.
