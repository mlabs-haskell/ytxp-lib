The high-level offer flow looks like this:

- Someone creates an offer.
- Either the offer owner will reclaim the offer,
- or a buyer will execute the offer.

## Components

## Transaction Families

- [Offer Creating](transaction-families/creating.md)
- [Offer Executing](transaction-families/executing.md)
