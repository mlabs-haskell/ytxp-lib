# Yielding Transaction Pattern SDK (ytxp-sdk)

This library includes YTxP types and instances for serialization, pretty
printing, and testing.

These types correspond to both `cardano-api` and `plutus-ledger-api`, making it
sufficient to support the development of YTxP-style protocols in various onchain
languages (such as `plutus-tx` and `plutarch`) and offchain frameworks (such as
`sc-tools` and `atlas`).

For more information on using the `ytxp-sdk`, please go to the
[`ytxp-lib` documentation](https://github.com/mlabs-haskell/ytxp-lib).
